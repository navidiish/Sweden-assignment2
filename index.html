        <p>Scene 1:</p>
        <p>For the first scene, we will have a ship that leaves a port and heads out to sea.</p>
        <p>The texts are placed in the waves, following the movement accordingly. </p>
        <p>There once was a ship that put to sea</p>
        <p>The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea</p>
        <p>The winds blew up, her bow dipped down</p>
        <p>O blow, my bully boys, blow</p>

        <item class="container__item">
        <p>Scene 2:</p>
        <p>The fishermen are looking at the whale from the boat. The text would be shown in the Whales mouth and getting smaller while falling deeper into the whales' throat.</p>
        <br>
        <p>She had not been two weeks from shore</p>  
        <p>When down on her a right whale bore</p>  
        <p>The captain called all hands and swore</p>  
        <p>He'd take that whale in tow</p>
        </item>
    
        <item class="container__item">
        <p>Scene 3:</p>
        <p>Several destroyed boats around with the whale swimming between them. 
        The text will be around the sunset, where it is moving around and disappearing into the water.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For forty days, or even more</p>
        <p>The line went slack, then tight once more</p>
        <p>All boats were lost, there were only four</p>
        <p>But still that whale did go</p>
        </item>
    
        <item class="container__item">
        <p>Scene 4:</p>
        <p>A crewmate “says” “the fights still on”. The rest of the text appears around the speech bubble.</p>
        <p>The song lyrics are shown from the start to the end of the scene.</p>
        <p>The Chat bubble is the only one that is styled using CSS, where it appears when the part is mentioned in the song. It should be colored and bold.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on</p>
        <p>The line's not cut and the whale's not gone</p>
        <p>The wellerman makes his regular call</p>
        <p>To encourage the captain, crew and all</p>  
        </item>
    
        <item class="container__item">
        <p>Scene 5:</p>
        <p>One of the other crewmates thinks about the rewards he will get after the whale is caught. 
        The lyrics are here appearing among the smoke form his pipe. They are styled using CSS and moving upwards.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>Soon may the wellerman come</p>
        <p>To bring us sugar and tea and rum</p>
        <p>One day, when the tonguin' is done</p>
        <p>We'll take our leave and go</p>
