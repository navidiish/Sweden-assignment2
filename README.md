# Assignment in CCS Advanced - SWEDEN
This is a repository for our course in CSS Advanced at NTNU Gjøvik.

## 1. Presentation of our project

Our assignment was to animate a text using css. We had some guidelines as to what we could do, but these were loose enough to let us be creative with both our idea and with the execution of said idea. We are currently 3 people in our group Sweden. Navid, Richard and Ole Ragnar.  

The text we chose to animate was “Wellerman”, a song about trying to catch a whale for a hefty reward. 

Idea: We chose 4 verses and the chorus of the song to base our project on. Since it is a whaling song, we went for a fisherman/pirate theme. We started out following the story of the song but ended up deviating from it a bit, to make our project more interesting. 

We also decided to have an option to play the song alongside the animations. 
 
 
 
 
## 2. Description of the technical stack

- FL studio (to make the music that plays alongside the animations)  

- Lighthouse (to test our projects performance) 

- Teams (to communicate and share files like svgs and brainstorming documents) 

- Visual Studio Code (HTML & CSS, to make our project) 

- Adobe Illustrator (to make svgs and jpgs) 

- Chrome (to test our project and search for solutions) 

- Github (to work on the project among the team) 


 

## 3. Describe interesting use cases of Advanced CSS in your project to the audience

- BEM was used for a better organization of our classes 

- SASS (SCSS): used to keep things organized by using variables, nested rules, inline import, partials and so on. 


- We created all of our drawings in Illustrator 

- Font: Pirata One, downloaded from Google 

- @Keyframes used for the animations 

- Opacity used at times to make our animations more interesting 

- Iteration-count (creates a loop), we chose to set it to infinite so people can take their time when watching the project.

- We tried to make the music sync up with the animations, but we didn’t manage to do so. Instead we made it so that you can play each part of the song to the corresponding scene. You also have the option to play the full version of the song at the top of the page.
